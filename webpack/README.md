# Webpack

Samples for increasingly complicated webpack projects:

1. [Hello, World!](https://github.com/full-stack-bcn/samples/tree/master/webpack/hello-webpack): a webpack project without specific configuration.

2. [Simple Config](https://github.com/full-stack-bcn/samples/tree/master/webpack/webpack-simplest-config): a webpack project with configuration only for ``entry`` and ``output``.

3. [CSS Config](https://github.com/full-stack-bcn/samples/tree/master/webpack/webpack-css): a base configuration with CSS loaders (``style-loader`` and ``css-loader``).
